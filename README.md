A timed racing game where the layout and the length of the track are generated based off the song chosen. 
Around the track (background) there will be 3d visualisations that are also generated based on the frequencies in the current song playing. 
The racetrack can also have some sort of speedboosts or barriers that can allow to to finish quicker.
Controller support can be added to control the car/ship, and VR support for immersion.
